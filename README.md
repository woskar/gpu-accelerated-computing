# GPU Accelerated Computing

Here you’ll find notes on accelerating computing with graphics processing units. I attended a [course](http://wwwstaff.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/mitarbeiter/spurzem/lehre/SS17/cuda/cuda.php.en) given by Rainer Spurzem at Heidelberg University in July 2017. A good resource is „CUDA by example“ by Jason Sanders and Edward Kandrot. While CUDA (used in the course) is proprietary software from NVIDIA, there is the OpenSource alternative OpenCL.
